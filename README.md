# BallSample

This is one of the sample apps used in the course Decoding Swift for Unity Developers. As an exercise, please use this VisionOS project as a starting point for learning more about Swift and the Apple Vision Pro.

Try to complete the following tasks:

A) Falling Bodies
1. Open Reality Composer Pro.
2. Find and open the FallingBalls scene.
3. Notice that when you play the app, the right ball drops but the left ball does not.
4. Try to add the right components to the right ball in order to make it also drop.

B) A Different Color
1. Open Reality Composer Pro.
2. Find and open the FallingBalls scene.
3. Figure out how to create a new "red" shader in Shader Graph.
4. Add your new color to the left ball, so the left ball is now red and the right ball is turquoise.

C) An Experiment
1. Open Reality Composer Pro.
2. Find and open the FallingBalls scene.
3. Select the Floor plane.
4. The current Physics Body mode is kinematic. Change this and see how it affects the Balls app.

D) Another Experiment
1. Open Reality Composer Pro.
2. Find and open the FallingBalls scene.
3. Select the Floor plane.
4. Set the Physics Body mode back to kinematic.
5. Remove the Collision component from the Floor plane and see how it affects the Balls app.

E) Advanced Challenge
1. In Xcode, open ContentView.
2. This is really hard - add a new toggle to your View and figure out how to reset the balls and make them fall again.
